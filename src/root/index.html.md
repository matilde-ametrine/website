**Matilde Ametrine** (formerly Nikki Lydeen) has been a student in the
[climate dynamics](https://science.gmu.edu/academics/departments-units/atmospheric-oceanic-earth-sciences/climate-dynamics-phd/)
Ph.D. program at George Mason University since August 2019.
She received a B.S. in physics and mathematics from the University of
Wisconsin-Eau Claire in December 2018.

Her current research focus is on statistical learning approaches for parameter
estimation (e.g. ensemble Kalman inversion) in connection with the
[Community Earth System Model](https://cesm.ucar.edu/) (CESM).

She is interested in climate science, botany, artificial intelligence,
declarative systems (e.g. [Nixpkgs/NixOS](https://nixos.org)), mesh networks
(e.g. [Yggdrasil](https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/)), hydrothermal
phenomena (e.g. geysers), and outdoor activities such as caving and kayaking.
